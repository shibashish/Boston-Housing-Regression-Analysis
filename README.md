# Boston Housing Regression Analysis

I used the Boston Housing Data set to impletent the gradient descent algorithm. Subsequently, I used regression to build a model that predicts the housing prices.

This was part of the INFX-574 class at the University of Washington, that I was a part of during Spring 2017.
